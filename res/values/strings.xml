		    So here\'s how this works.  Input your income and recurring \'expenses\' (savings, rent, student loans, etc).  I strongly recommend putting money in savings
		    to cover unpredicted expense (i.e. speeding tickets). The remainder is spending money for items of highly variable cost (i.e. food, gas, clothes, etc).   
		    
		    Say for instance you make $1227.12 every 2 weeks after taxes, you might input the following
		    Income:    $1200 every 2 weeks
		    Save:      $200 every 2 weeks
		    Rent:      $500 monthly
		    Utilities: $120 monthly
		    Loans:     $400 monthly
		    Gym Fee:   $50 monthly
		    Insurance: $550 bi-yearly
		    
		    You can spend about $33 per day. (will be calculated for you)
		    
		    So instead of getting your pay check and thinking \"now I have a bulk of money to spend!\" you will instead only allow yourself to spend $33 of it each day.
		    This should help you keep a tight understanding of your finances and give you a better understanding of what things cost.
		    
		    So let\'s get started!
