    <string name="example_use">Let\'s say you\'re salaried at $40,000 a year.  But your bi-weekly pay check is $1230.  Multiply it by 26 (number of bi-weeks in a year) and you make ~$32,000 after taxes.\n
\n
So an example would look like this.\n
ANNUAL INCOME: 32000\n
\n
REPEATING EXPENSES: Rent|500 per month, Student Loans|500 per month, Savings|500 per month, Cell Phone|60 per month, Cable/Internet|80 per month, Car Insurance|400 per bi-year, Electric|80 per month\n
\n
EXPENSE CATEGORIES: Groceries, Gas, Eating Out, Clothes, Fun Purchases, Car Maintenance, Miscellaneous\n
\n
So your \'bills\' (including savings) are $21,440 per year, leaving you with $10,560 for spending on your "Expense Categories", or about $30 per day.\n
\n
So if over the course of two weeks our imaginary person spends $80 on gas, $120 eating out, $80 on groceries, and buys a $30 gift for their S.O., their balance will be at $110 at the end of 2 weeks (It\'s a good idea to keep a buffer in case of something like a speeding ticket, but an emergency expense is also why it\'s VERY important to allocate money to savings).
